# Pizza_Sales_Sql_Analysis
This project showcases a comprehensive SQL-based analysis of a pizza sales dataset, involving four relational tables: orders, order_details, pizzas, and pizza_types. The goal is to uncover customer preferences, sales trends, and revenue insights using structured queries across basic, intermediate, and advanced levels.
## SQL Query Sections
## Basic Queries
- Total number of orders placed
- Total revenue generated from pizza sales
- Highest-priced pizza
- Most common pizza size ordered
- Top 5 most ordered pizza types with quantities
## Intermediate Queries
- Total quantity of each pizza category ordered
- Distribution of orders by hour of the day
- Category-wise distribution of pizzas
- Average number of pizzas ordered per day
- Top 3 most ordered pizza types based on revenue
## Advanced Queries
- Percentage contribution of each pizza type to total revenue
- Cumulative revenue generated over time
- Top 3 most ordered pizza types by revenue for each pizza category

## Sample Insights
- Classic pizzas are most popular; Chicken least.
- Large size is preferred by customers.
- Top-selling pizza: Classic Deluxe  Least: Brie Carre
- Average price: $37  Avg quantity: 2
- Peak order time: 12â€“1 PM  Most orders on Friday

 ## Tools Used
 
- MySQL Woekbench

## Results
  After executing a series of SQL queries across four interconnected tables (orders,  order_details, pizzas, pizza_types), the following insights were derived:
- Total Orders: A precise count of all unique orders placed.
- Total Revenue: Calculated by multiplying quantity and price across all pizzas sold.
- Top Pizza: Classic Deluxe Pizza emerged as the highest-selling item.
- Least Pizza: Brie Carre Pizza had the lowest sales.
- Preferred Size: Customers most frequently ordered Large (L) pizzas.
- Popular Category: Classic pizzas dominated sales; Chicken pizzas were least preferred.
- Average Order: Customers typically spent $37 and ordered 2 pizzas per transaction.
- Peak Time: Most orders were placed between 12:00 PM and 1:00 PM.
- Popular Day: Friday saw the highest order volume; Sunday the lowest.
- Revenue Distribution: A few pizza types contributed disproportionately to total revenue.
- Cumulative Revenue: Showed consistent growth over time, with spikes during peak hours and days.


## Conclusion 
This SQL-driven analysis provided valuable business intelligence into customer behavior and sales performance. By leveraging relational joins, aggregations, and time-based queries, we uncovered:
- Clear product preferences that can guide inventory and marketing.
- Time and day patterns that inform staffing and promotional strategies.
- Revenue insights that highlight high-performing items and underperformers.
The project demonstrates how structured query language (SQL) can be used not just for data retrieval, but for generating actionable insights that support decision-making in retail and food service environments.
